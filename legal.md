This is a personal website and should not have complicated rules. Nevertheless, I must clarify some things.

Effective July 13, 2021. Anything on this page only applies to websites.

## Privacy

I do not collect personally-identifiable information.

I cannot modify/delete your data if I don't have access to them to begin with.

### austinhuang.me

No cookies are used/stored.

* First-party:
    * No Google fonts. No Cloudflare.
    * I use analytics from [GoatCounter](https://goatcounter.com). It's [open source](https://github.com/zgoat/goatcounter). Here are [public stats for this website](https://0131.goatcounter.com) (I can see no more info than what you can see there) and [their privacy policy](https://www.goatcounter.com/privacy). You can disable this by blocking `gc.zgo.at` through your adblocker.
* Third-party non-interactive:
    * Site is hosted by GitHub pages. See [their privacy statement](https://docs.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-privacy-statement).
    * The homepage pings a RSS feed at `api.flickr.com` to fetch my photos. [This script](https://austinhuang.me/javascript-flickr-badge.min.js) is used. You can disable this by blocking `api.flickr.com` through your adblocker.
* Third-party interactive:
    * YouTube embeds exist on the BVE guide, though `www.youtube-nocookie.com` ("enhanced privacy mode") is used. Feel free to replace it with Invidious or something else, I don't mind.
    * Donation: If you pay by card, then Stripe handles the payment; If you pay by PayPal, then PayPal handles the payment **and I will see your address** (Because I have a business account; I will not release the address to anyone other than the client). Therefore, for the greater good (At least for now, I don't pay fees if you use Stripe, but I do if you use PayPal), *please* use Stripe, unless PayPal balance is all you got.
    * I'm not gonna explain external links. Research them yourself.

* This website represents my *personal opinion* and, unless otherwise specified, is not endorsed by parties that I involve with.
