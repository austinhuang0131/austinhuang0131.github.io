~~My Instagram is a mess.~~

## May I ask some questions?
~~No u.~~ Obviously, sure.

### Hobbies?
Coding, modeling, mapping, commenting on local/global affairs, and listening to sick beats ~~as well as memeing~~ are things I do a lot. And Anime sometimes (1~3 series per year). Skating, softball and badminton, especially, are my favourite sports ~~given that me being a not-so-sporty kid~~.

Recently I found myself enjoying model united nations. I've been to [SSUNS](http://www.ssuns.org/), [MariMUN](https://marimun.com/) and [JACMUN](http://jacmun.org/).

### Hardware?
A school-provided MacBook Air plus several shared VPS from online people ~~comrades~~ and free services. That's it.

### You said you're from...Shanghai?
~~No u.~~ Yeah. I actually went to the same high school as [@simonguozirui](https://github.com/simonguozirui) did and went abroad at the same time as he did, though he's 1 year older than me.

### What about a formal resume, *please?*
No u. *skirt skirt dab dab*

Fun fact: I dab every several minutes when awake.

### Hey, you look cool. How can I support you?
You can [buy my services](/services) or [donate to me](/donate)!

### What other stuff are there on this website?
You can have a look at the [sitemap](/sitemap).
