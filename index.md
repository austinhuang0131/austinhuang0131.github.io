Hi there! I [write code](https://github.com/austinhuang0131), [take photos](#my-photos), study, and [explore online stuff](#my-other-online-stuff). You may reach me using [these methods](#hey-you-look-cool). Straight outta the metropolis of Shanghai, China, I currently reside in Montr√©al, Canada, studying statistics & computer science at McGill University.

A **redacted** version of my resume is available [here](./assets/online_resume.pdf) for public viewing. Employers should [contact me](#contact-me) instead.

I believe that I am known for making [Barinsta](./barinsta.html), an open source Instagram client on Android that focuses on privacy and well-being. Ultimately I was [cease & desisted by Facebook](https://github.com/austinhuang0131/austinhuang0131/issues/2) but at least I got some clout, so that's cool.

I used to be heavily invested in Discord and have written [private Discord/Telegram bots](/services.html), but since then I became a proponent of federated platforms, namely Matrix and ActivityPub. I also operate some public privacy-focused services at [bus-hit.me](https://bus-hit.me).

## My photos

<div class="resize2" id="myElement" style="float:right;padding:15px;"></div>
<script type="text/javascript" src="./assets/javascript-flickr-badge.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">
   jsFlickrBadge(document.getElementById('myElement'), {
       flickrId: '136075370@N04',
       feed: 'user',
       tags: '',
       rows: 4,
       columns: 4,
       size: 75,
       animation: 'flipX',
       animationSpeed: 1,
       animationPause: 2
     });
</script>

I have a white Pentax K-50. I upload ~~all~~ some ("Good" ones, due to Flickr's free restrictions) of my photos on my [Flickr](https://flic.kr/austin0131). I'm currently moving most of my photos to [Zonerama](https://austinhuang0131.zonerama.com). I also post loyalty-free ones on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/@austinhuang).

## May I ask some questions?
Sure. You can even comment below to ask even more questions, eh?

### Hobbies?
Coding, mapping (or, more professionally, *urban planning*), commenting on local/global affairs, model UN, and listening to some beats (80~90s/country/jazz/blues/memes/J-pop, also classical/organ remixes... But I hate the new funky stuff. Gross.) ~~as well as memeing~~ are things I do a lot. I do admit though that I watch some anime (less than 4 series per year, steadily decreasing because of time constraints).

#### Coding?
I occasionally contribute to some open source projects, mainly by reviving abandoned F-Droid-compliant Android apps. Barinsta was no exception. I have done some work on and am planning to maintain [Canada Weather & Radar](https://github.com/austinhuang0131/CanadaWeather) and [Pix-EzViewer](https://github.com/ultranity/Pix-EzViewer) in the near future. But, y'kno, study first.

#### Model UN?

Model UN is great (if in-person). Even if you're not into politics, this giant social-party atmosphere will pull you into this extravaganza, and also allows you to meet some of the best people you'll ever make friends with! (It is quite expensive though, would like to see it becoming more affordable, but eh.)

### Hardware?
A school-provided (now owned) fully-stickered repaired-once MacBook Air (13-inch, 2017).

Used to be able to run stuff on VPSs, but I guess we live in turbulent times...

My phone is a Sony Xperia XA2, model H3123.

### You from Shanghai?
Glad you asked! I'm proud of my Shanghainese heritage. Also, I speak Shanghainese!
