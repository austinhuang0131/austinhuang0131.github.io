Hi there! I'm a college ([cégep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEGEP)) student who [writes code](https://github.com/austinhuang0131), [takes photos](#my-photos), studies, and [explores online stuff](#my-other-online-stuff-like-social-media). You may reach me using [these methods](#hey-you-look-cool). Straight outta the metropolis of Shanghai, China, I currently reside in Montréal, Canada.

If you need a job title, that'll be "college student/freelance project maintainer". I just put everything on my website, it's not actually a *resume*.

## My own projects

### Currently in progress
* [InstaGrabber](https://instagrabber.austinhuang.me) is an open source Instagram client on Android. Previously owned by [AWAiS](https://gitlab.com/AwaisKing).
* I made [a school shuttle bus tracker](https://stm.austinhuang.me), mostly for my classmates. (Stagnant due to coronavirus.)
* I co-founded [DISBOARD](https://disboard.org) and I remain as an Administrator there.

### Founded by me
* [Discoin](http://discoin.gitbooks.io/docs) is a currency exchange serving multiple Discord bots. Co-Owned with [PizzaFox](https://jonah.pw).
* [DTel](https://dtel.austinhuang.me) is a Discord bot that simulates the process of phone dialing on Discord servers. Co-Owned with [Mitchell](https://github.com/mitchell3514).

I also write [private Discord/Telegram bots](/services) for individuals, and operate [a Bibliogram instance](https://bg.endl.site).

## My photos

<div class="resize2" id="myElement" style="float:right;"></div>
<script type="text/javascript" src="./assets/javascript-flickr-badge.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">
   jsFlickrBadge(document.getElementById('myElement'), {
       flickrId: '136075370@N04',
       feed: 'user',
       tags: '',
       rows: 4,
       columns: 4,
       size: 75,
       animation: 'flipX',
       animationSpeed: 1,
       animationPause: 2
     });
</script>

I have a white Pentax K-50. I upload ~~all~~ some ("Good" ones, due to Flickr's free restrictions) of my photos on my [Flickr](https://flic.kr/austin0131). I'm currently moving most of my photos to [Zonerama](https://austinhuang0131.zonerama.com). I also post loyalty-free ones on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/@austinhuang).

## My other online stuff

Tryna quit social media, but still can't get away with the critical mass. *\*Sigh\**

* [Matrix room](https://matrix.to/#/#bistro:privacytools.io)
* [OpenGeofiction](http://opengeofiction.net/user/austinhuang/history): A collaborative platform for creating fictional maps.
* [Pixiv](https://pixiv.me/montreal0131): A collection of illustrations I like.
* [Reddit](http://reddit.com/u/austinhuang)

## May I ask some questions?
Sure. You can even comment below to ask even more questions, eh?

### Hobbies?
Coding, mapping (or, more professionally, *urban planning*), commenting on local/global affairs, model UN, and listening to some beats (80~90s/country/jazz/blues/memes/news intro, also classical/organ remixes... But I hate the new funky stuff. Gross.) ~~as well as memeing~~ are things I do a lot. Watches some anime (less than 4 series per year).

#### Model UN?
<img src="./assets/model_un.jpg" alt="Name tags of attended MUN conferences" align="right" width="300"/>

Model UN is great. Strongly recommended. Even if you're not into politics, this giant social-party atmosphere will pull you into this extravaganza, and also allows you to meet some of the best people you'll ever make friends with! (It is quite expensive though, would like to see it becoming more affordable, but eh.)

### Hardware?
A school-provided (now owned) fully-stickered repaired-once MacBook Air (13-inch, 2017) plus several shared VPS from online people ~~comrades~~ and free services (e.g. [Glitch](https://glitch.com)). That's it.

### You from Shanghai?
Glad you asked! I'm proud of my Shanghainese heritage. Also, I speak Shanghainese!
