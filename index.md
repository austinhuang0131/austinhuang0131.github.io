Hi there! I [write code](https://github.com/austinhuang0131), [take photos](#my-photos), study, and [explore online stuff](#my-other-online-stuff). You may reach me using [these methods](#contact-me). Straight outta the metropolis of Shanghai, China, I currently reside in Montr√©al, Canada, studying statistics & computer science at McGill University.

A **redacted** version of my resume is available [here](./assets/online_resume.pdf) for public viewing. Employers should [contact me](#contact-me) instead.

I believe that I am known for making [Barinsta](./barinsta.html), an open source Instagram client on Android that focuses on privacy and well-being. Ultimately I was [cease & desisted by Facebook](https://github.com/austinhuang0131/austinhuang0131/issues/2) but at least I got some clout, so that's cool.

I used to be heavily invested in Discord and have written [private Discord/Telegram bots](/services.html), but since then I became a proponent of ethical platforms, namely Matrix and ActivityPub. I also operate some public privacy-focused services at [bus-hit.me](https://bus-hit.me).

## The tech stuff

### My Open Source Contributions

<a href="https://www.techpledge.org/"><img src="./assets/Pledge_badge.svg" alt="https://www.techpledge.org/" width="125" /></a>
</div>

I occasionally contribute to some open source projects, including:

* Maintaining abandoned or near-abandoned Android apps, like fixing bugs and bringing them to F-Droid standards. Barinsta was no exception. [Canada Weather & Radar](https://github.com/austinhuang0131/CanadaWeather), [MyMartlet](https://github.com/jguerinet/MyMartlet), and [Pix-EzViewer](https://github.com/ultranity/Pix-EzViewer) fall into this category as well.
* Adding features to selfhostable software, including [imgin](https://git.voidnet.tech/kev/imgin), [teddit](https://codeberg.org/teddit/teddit), and [PrivateBin](https://github.com/PrivateBin/PrivateBin/).

### My Hardware

A school-provided (now owned) fully-stickered repaired-once MacBook Air (13-inch, 2017).

My phone is a Sony Xperia XA2, model H3123.

My VM stack is composed of the free stuff from Oracle.

## My photos

<div class="resize2" id="myElement" style="float:right;padding:15px;"></div>
<script type="text/javascript" src="./assets/javascript-flickr-badge.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">
   jsFlickrBadge(document.getElementById('myElement'), {
       flickrId: '136075370@N04',
       feed: 'user',
       tags: '',
       rows: 4,
       columns: 4,
       size: 75,
       animation: 'flipX',
       animationSpeed: 1,
       animationPause: 2
     });
</script>

I have a white Pentax K-50. I upload some ("Good" ones, due to Flickr's free restrictions) of my photos on my [Flickr](https://flic.kr/austin0131). I also post loyalty-free ones on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/@austinhuang).
