On July 26, 2021, I received a cease & desist letter[^1] from *Perkins Coie LLP*, a law firm representing Facebook. As a result, Barinsta is no longer maintained or distributed by me, and no updates will be provided to the `me.austinhuang.instagrabber` package. All crash reports sent to `barinsta@austinhuang.me` after that date are ignored[^2].

Those in possession of the source code and/or the binaries should be aware of the terms and conditions set out by the [GNU General Public License, Version 3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html), which remains applicable to Barinsta. Nevertheless, the app is expected to function for the foreseeable future.

The developers of Barinsta sincerely appreciate your continuous support.

This page may be updated as needed in the future.
