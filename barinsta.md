On July 26, 2021, I received a cease & desist letter from *Perkins Coie LLP*, a law firm representing Facebook. (The unredacted letter is [available online](https://github.com/austinhuang0131/austinhuang0131/issues/2).) As a result, Barinsta is no longer maintained or distributed by me, and no updates will be provided to the `me.austinhuang.instagrabber` package. All crash reports sent to `barinsta@austinhuang.me` after that date are ignored.

Those in possession of the source code and/or the binaries should be aware of the terms and conditions set out by the [GNU General Public License, Version 3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html), which remains applicable to Barinsta. Nevertheless, the app is expected to function for the near future.

The developers of Barinsta sincerely appreciate your continuous support.
