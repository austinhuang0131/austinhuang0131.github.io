On July 26, 2021, I received a cease & desist letter[^1] from *Perkins Coie LLP*, a law firm representing Facebook. As a result, Barinsta is no longer maintained or distributed by me, and no updates will be provided to the `me.austinhuang.instagrabber` package. All crash reports sent to `barinsta@austinhuang.me` after that date are ignored[^2].

Those in possession of the source code and/or the binaries should be aware of the terms and conditions set out by the [GNU General Public License, Version 3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html), which remains applicable to Barinsta. Nevertheless, the app is expected to function for the foreseeable future.

The developers of Barinsta sincerely appreciate your continuous support.

Amended May 22, 2022: I have received a lot of emails from others who are in the same situation asking me what to do. I'll write them here, noting that **this is NOT legal advice**:

1. **Take down your app to the best of _your ability_, as soon as possible.**
2. **Don't say another word to them.** This means, in particular, that you **don't** respond to any emails from them, present or future.
3. Please consult a lawyer, especially if you have significant revenue from your app. (If you, like me, are making a non-profit personal-use app, unfortunately advocacy representations are very rare, so don't get your hopes too high.)

Please understand, that being banned off Facebook is a blessing, not a curse. Meanwhile, check out [the greener pasture](https://joinfediverse.wiki/Welcome_to_the_Fediverse_Quickstart_guide)!
