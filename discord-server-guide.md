Running a Discord server is not easy and I've seen numerous people struggling with it. From my personal experience, here's some advice from me, I guess.

This guide is WIP and will remain WIP. [Suggestions are welcomed at any time.](https://github.com/austinhuang0131/austinhuang0131.github.io/blob/master/discord-server-guide.md)

Revised May 8, 2018.

## Questions to ask yourself
Before making a Discord server, you should ask yourself these questions:

1. What's the purpose of your server, in the most specific way possible? (Possible answer would be "We're enthusiastic in <specific game/topic>". Don't answer "bots" or "staff".)
2. Is it unique?
3. How will you engage your population (Keep your members) in the future?

There is no correct answer to them, but you should at least be able to answer these questions keep them in mind. If you answered "No" to question 2, you should focus more on question 3.

## Let's start!
### With a specific purpose
Personally, I suggest that you should find some people (10 is enough) who have interest or expertise in your field to start the server, so that it'll be easier to find new members as they'll have a reference in what's going on.

### With a generic purpose
Just a community? It's not the end of the world, but that'll be fairly difficult to bring your people up. Easy to maintain, though.

## How do I keep my members in my server?
It's not a business of attracting more people: It's more like a business of keeping your population in shape. So, servers need events to give people initiatives.

### Events
Let's break them up into 3 types.
#### Type 1: Strengthening your purpose => Get new people, and keep your members
You're running a game server? Game tournaments! You're running an art server? Work exchange! You're running an anime server? What about dub challenge?

This type of events highly depends on your server's purpose and also resources available to you. They are highly effective but at the same time consume a lot of your time and energy (Question 3) so you should keep a balance between these events and regular activities.

#### Type 2: Generic engagement activities => Keep your members
Minigames (Like [Cards Against Humanity](http://pretendyoure.xyz/zy/), [UNO](http://www.richgieg.com/runo) and [Webopoly](http://www.webopoly.org/), sure you'll find more) as well as other small events (Like movie night, karaoke, etc) can be used to keep your members busy. They require less effort than type 1 events, but they won't bring in new members, and there is a limit on how many you can do: Too many minigames can dilute your purpose which may lead to losing members.

#### Type 3: Give one shot => Get new people
Giveaways with attractive prizes will surely bring in new people [when used with proper advertisement](#advertising). They might not have an effect on your existing members though.

But after all, you can't do events all the time. So there's also...

### Regular activities
Chat, obviously! But chat about what? You certainly need [responsible staff](#choosing-staff) to start topics and engage in conversations. Members need to feel that...

* You cares about them
* They have certain value in the server
* THey enjoy staying in your server
* They have things to talk about

## How do I increase my population?
Once you know how to keep your population, you should impose measures to increase your member count.

### Advertising
Your advertising slogan/text/description should point out what you have (Purpose and/or Type 1 events) plus some attractive treats (Type 3 events). Try create several versions of it, long ones for listing servers and short ones for listing websites. Though, do keep it short and on point in general.

[This page](/./advertising) lists most places for advertising. Remember to bump your server regularly to keep your server at the top of rankings.

Partnerships are not recommended as the mutual benefit is negligible (~10 members for an average server). Your server can live without partnerships, for that I'm sure.

## Misc
### Choosing staff
Three ways.
#### Direct appointment
If you have enthusiastic friends who would help you to get their goal, then surely appointing them is the best choice. But you must be sure! If your friends are rebellious...
#### Application
Most commonly used method. Let your members explain what they have and what they're able to do. However, lack of objective views can cause missteps in choosing staffs.
#### Election
Personally, I let my members elect their moderators. This is very objective and my members satisfy. However, without constantly refreshing population, there's hardly a challenge for the elected.
### Bots
**DON'T** add a lot of bots, or mention your bots as one of the features of your server anywhere. You should only use bots that you will truly use, or your server can give new members a bad impression. You should also place the bot role lower if you choose to display it.

In most situations, you only need 1 bot to faciliate moderation on phones and have an alternative audit log. You can add some other bots for minigames and advertising.
