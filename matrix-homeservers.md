title: List of public Matrix homeservers
description: Support the decentralization of Matrix by getting your account on an alternative homeserver!
---

This is a list of public Matrix homeservers as compiled by me. Support for this list is provided at [`#public_servers:asra.gr`](https://matrix.to/#/#public_servers:asra.gr). For long-term usage, choose a homeserver that you trust, [is properly federated](https://federationtester.matrix.org/), has policies suitable to your use, and is designed to last. Remember, any homeserver you choose gets to access all the unencrypted data about your account!

**Disclaimer:**

* Inclusion does **NOT** imply any opinion (affiliation, endorsement, etc.) on individual homeservers, nor any guarantee regarding their availability.
* This list is provided "as is." Any dispute regarding your account on one of the homeservers should be resolved between you and the operator(s) of the homeserver.

## List

Alphabetically-ordered by the display name. See criteria and legends below.

## Why?

Ideally you would host your own homeserver, but not everyone has the means... Anyway, you should use a homeserver other than the default `matrix.org` because...

1. It is overloaded at times, and
2. If everyone continues to register on the same homeserver, then it will become more centralized, thus shifting away from the original goal of Matrix.

This list exists because...

1. It is necessary to let people discover other homeservers available to them,
2. It is necessary to let other homeservers be discovered by those interested,
3. Other existing lists suffer from low quality or abandonment, and
4. Practical aspects (such as rules) are often overlooked.

## Criteria

The absolute criteria are:

* The homeserver allows public registration.
* The homeserver name must be a second-level domain (so `example.com` is acceptable, but `matrix.example.com` is not).
* The homeserver is neither `matrix.org` nor operated by Element Matrix Services (previously known as Modular).
* The homeserver is known to me as intended for public, either through my understanding of materials, or through explicit consent from the homeserver operator(s).
* The homeserver does not have an ongoing Mjolnir server ban (`m.room.rule.server`) on:
  * `#matrix-org-coc-bl:matrix.org`: [matrix.org Code of Conduct](https://matrix.org/legal/code-of-conduct/) ban list, which contains homeservers suspected of promoting spam, hate speech, or harassment. It is  used on many popular public rooms (that are not necessarily affiliated with Matrix itself).
  * `#matrix-org-hs-tos-bl:matrix.org`: [matrix.org Homeserver Terms of Service](https://matrix.org/legal/terms-and-conditions/) ban list, which contains homeservers suspected of promoting illegal content.

Some homeservers are excluded from this list on content grounds.

## Legend

* **Homeserver name**: This is the part that follows your username. For example, my ID is `@austin:tchncs.de`, where `austin` is my username and `tchncs.de` is the display name of the homeserver. This is not necessarily the domain used for connections: As seen [here](https://tchncs.de/.well-known/matrix/client), a client would connect to `https://matrix.tchncs.de` instead.
* **Registration method**: Exact registration procedure. Those are tested (but not necessarily thoroughly) on [the official Element web client](https://app.element.io) and, in most cases, should work for other clients as well.
  * Empty: After clicking "Create Account" and "Edit," you may enter the display name in the previous column (without `https://`) to create an account.
  * A domain: After clicking "Create Account" and "Edit," you may enter the domain as specified in this column (without `https://`) to create an account.
  * "In-house Element": You must register using the Element client hosted on the homeserver, which is linked. This is usually due to reCaptcha domain restriction.
  * "SSO": The homeserver requires [single sign-on](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on) for authentication. You must create an account through the link prior to creating an account on the Matrix homeserver itself. Usually, the account can be used to access other services offered by the homeserver operator.
* **Operating structure**: The type of entity that is operating the homeserver.
  * "Individual": Operated by one person.
  * "Individual(s)": Operated by multiple people that are not considered a "community".
  * "Community": Operated by multiple people with a clear ideological goal/purpose.
  * "Commercial": Operated by a commercial entity, or an entity that offers paid services.
* **Jurisdiction (and Server location)**: The jurisdiction the homeserver is located within. The server location, if differs from the jurisdiction of the homeserver, is shown in the brackets. Note that generally, homeservers located in Germany are more actively moderated due to [legal and social contexts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_in_Germany#Re-unified_Germany_(1990%E2%80%93present)).
* **Rules?**: The existence of explicit Rules/ToS for all users on the homeserver. Note that rules can only be considered if they apply to all activities (not just those in specific rooms) of a user. In terms of format, a "CoC" means that there exists a code of conduct for all users, which is usually stricter than the usual rules, and a "ToS" means that there exists a contract-style terms of service for all users. An "unclear" or "sort of" means the privacy policy's scope or wording is unclear.
* **Privacy Policy?**: The existence of explicit Privacy Policy for all users on the homeserver. Generally, applicable sections of [Matrix.org Privacy Notice](https://matrix.org/legal/privacy-notice/) applies network-wide. Note that "same as matrix.org" should be treated as a "no." An "unclear" or "sort of" means the privacy policy's scope or wording is unclear, and a "generic" means the privacy policy may be generated from a template.
* **Privacy merits/concerns?**: Notes for the privacy situation of the homeserver. By default, email is required for registration.
  * "reCaptcha": Registering on the homeserver requires filling out a Google reCaptcha. This does not apply to logins. Due to reCaptcha configurations, it may be necessary to register on the homeserver's own Element client.
  * "Email optional": Registering on the homeserver does not require an email address. This can offer privacy benefits, but may cause the homeserver to be susceptible to spam.
* **Note**: Miscellaneous remarks. Note that a homeserver's theme/orientation can sometimes be seen from the domain itself, in which case it will not be noted down here.
  * "Too concise": Too little information is present about this homeserver.
  * "Accessory": The homeserver is intended to be used to access rooms related to the operator, although the accounts can access other federated rooms as well.
