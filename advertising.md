* **To add your server-listing server into this page**, your server should have *at least* 500 members (Reaching the population size does **NOT** guarantee a spot.) and a well-maintained listing (Expired invites are frequently cleaned, tidy categories, etc.). This **does not** mean that this guide is only suitable for servers with 500+ people which has became, surprisingly, a common misconception made by a lot of people.
* Currently, there is no restriction in adding listing websites or bots, as long as they're functional.
* No bot-listing servers.
  
### Websites
Sorted by size (Amount of guilds) as of April 16, 2018.

* [Discord.me](http://discord.me)
  * Largest (45000+ servers), most traffic
  * Server owners can bump every 6 hours, on site only
  * Custom link for invites (Discord.me)
  * 1 text-only page for a separate long description
* [Discord Servers](http://discservs.co)
  * Second-Largest (29000+ servers), probably oldest
  * More like a search engine
* [DiscordList.me](http://discordlist.me)
  * 24000+ servers
  * Server owners can bump every 6 hours for free, on site and on bot
  * Free custom link for invites (disco.gg)
* [DiscordList.net](http://discordlist.net)
  * 22000+ servers
  * Servers can only be submitted by ServerHound, its bot 
  * Server owners can bump every 4 hours for free, on bot only
<details><summary>Spoiler! (Not supported on IE)</summary>
ServerHound, their listing bot, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/search?q=serverhound">has a terrible reputation</a> and is frequently considered a botnet. The bot was caught <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/5sz8qo/does_serverhound_secretly_log_your_servers_chat/">monitored server messages before</a> <sup>In mid-2017, I worked with DiscordList and witnessed that some staff have access to "Radar", which logs global messages</sup> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/79e79e/serverhound_website_taken_down/">releasing all user data on another website called Discord.Solutions (Taken down)</a>. Some users reported that the website seems to be a target for raiding. Before, they also show live message in listed guilds and per-member stats on the website, which seems to be removed.
