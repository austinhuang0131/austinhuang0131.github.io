**Do NOT use dis.cool.** They scraped "35,000 servers, 12 million users" (according to its owners!) without consent by abusing the widget feature. **Please turn off Widget on your server.** This kind of thing has happened 2 times. We don't want a third.

### Listing Servers
Aside from websites and bot-served servers. Please note that servers may require you to stay in the server to keep your advertisement. Servers are ordered alphabetically. [This Google spreadsheet by cats#5485](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ia8VYVrnggQR1Kvb982DzbjZMXjqqrtETPVE9ri7Jag/edit#gid=0) provides a more detailed comparison of various servers. We are only listing the well-maintained ones here.
