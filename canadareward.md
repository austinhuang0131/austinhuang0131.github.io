This is a list of loyalty programs currently available to Canadians, ordered by reward rate (High to low), then alphabetically.

* The "reward" in "reward rate" is either cash, gift cards, or in-store rebates. That means merchandises (e.g. Air Miles' dream balance) are not included.
* Special rates applicable at events are not included.
* If the "availability" box is empty, that means the program is open to public with no conditions such as monthly fee or yearly spending.

This list is still being completed.
